This application was created using ES6 syntax(classes).
There are 5 independent classes: Sections (areas where you can store your note), Note (object of a note), Mode (object of state of mode), and two popups with menu and search-bar. Main functions are on Note class, they give you opportunities to edit, delete, pin and move items between areas.
This app follows to OOP principals. Each item has been presented of corresponding object (class).
Thank you for checking this app out.
